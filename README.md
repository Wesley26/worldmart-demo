# Worldmart React Native App (Demo version) #


This React Native App uses the following dependencies: [React Native Docs (expo)](https://reactnative.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Tailwind-RN](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn#readme).

NOTE: Use command `npx create-tailwind-rn` every time you update your tailwind.config.js file. This command is needed to create the styles.json file during development. The styles.json is un-tracked ONLY when purge is enabled.

This is the demo version meant only as a reference for future react native projects. This demo react native app is optimized for iOS.
